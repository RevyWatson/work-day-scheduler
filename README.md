# Work Day Scheduler
This was the fifth homework assignment for the [MSU Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.msu.edu/coding/landing/?s=Google-Brand_RFull_&msg_cv_scta=4&msg_cv_stbn=1&msg_cv_fcta=1&fqvar1=3&dki=Learn%20Coding&pkw=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=471460105653&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CMICHIGAN-STATE-UNIVERSITY%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7C_RFull_%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=msu%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=106134459970&utm_locationphysicalms=9016918&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=471460105653&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-OeBBhDiARIsADyBcE7Y_HuK3nbJPvfuQNXFO-pcYTApJovFYDJxTBtxpXeIn_4tCA74fnYaAqoAEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). The assignment was to build upon provided starter code (html and css) to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. To be accomplished by utilizing [jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/) and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

## Requirements
* When user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When user scrolls down then they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
* When user views the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When user clicks a timeblock they can enter an event.
* When user clicks the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When user refreshes the page the saved events remain present.

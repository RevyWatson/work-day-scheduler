## Requirements
* When user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* When user scrolls down then they are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
* When user views the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When user clicks a timeblock they can enter an event.
* When user clicks the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* When user refreshes the page the saved events remain present.
